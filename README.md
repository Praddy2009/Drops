# Drops
Water is an indispensable requirement for plant growth. If enough water is not provided to a plant at appropriate times, its growth may be erratic or stunted. This task is one of the main reasons people are hesitant about owning plants. Corporate work life prevents people from being able to give adequate time to their plants and ensure its well-being. This is a problem we aim to solve with Drops.

Drops is a plug-and-play device which incorporates IoT in its core. We created this product with an objective to give the user the ability to not only monitor the plants remotely but also water them with the push of a button over the internet. Drops has an add-on of Augmented Reality to enhance the user experience which brings the process of watering the plant in front of the userâ€™s eyes in a fun, interactive way using 3D models and animation
